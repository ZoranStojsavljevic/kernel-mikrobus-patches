They are working with the latest Linux trees kernels, with Robert C. Nelson's patches:

The mikrobus_core.c compilation introduces the following compiling warnings!

In order to make work Actual Mikrobus Patches, there were few changes to be done to
files 0001-mikrobus-driver-update-patch.patch & 0006-greybus-add-gb_netlink-patch.patch
to make latest kernels compile/link.

There is well known fact that Robert C Nelson made mikrobus.h as addition and
available in the kernel tree (positioned in the following location):

	.../include/linux/mikrobus.h

This file is known as mikrobus_core.h (and included in the mikrobus driver itself)
from the following Out Of Tree mikrobus driver:

These patches are not tested, not used still by author, thus they are in unknown
state *especially last two patches) for time being!

#### Overlays (for now this patch does not work - MUST be fixed!)
